#Refocus
---
Refocus is a chrome extension that delays your visits to distracting websites. This is in progress and was started with the goal of getting more familiar with Javascript (I'm still new so the code is far from ideal). 


I noticed that often when I hit a wall in what I'm doing, my hands will direct me to facebook or other distracting websites out of habit without my consent. Then I end up getting distracted and I lose track of what I was doing. There are extensions that completely block certain websites, but I usually end up turning those off and forgetting about them because they end up being an inconvenience at some point. By just implementing a short delay, this provides enough time to allow you to return to your current work without losing focus, but isn't too annoying if it's left on and you actually want to go to a "blacklisted" page.
